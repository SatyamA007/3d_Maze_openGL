# 3D Maze openGL for Computer Graphics CS280 S22 UCSB
In this homework, we write an OpenGL application that lets a user navigate a maze. Our application must do three things: <br/>
1) load the maze specification text file, parse it, and read in all the appropriate data into appropriate data structures, and <br/>
2) pass the geometry, texture information, etc. to the hardware and use OpenGL to render it, <br/>
3) handle the user input so they can navigate through the maze. <br/><br/>

In the last part of the assignment (Part 3) you will incorporate what you have learned in the first 2 parts to create your first “mini” OpenGL game. The idea is that in this homework assignment you will do everything in OpenGL, and in the next 3 assignments you will write a
software rasterizer that will do this in software.<br/><br/>
